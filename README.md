## Overview

**LocalHive** is a powerful development tool designed to streamline local application development. It provides a fully functional local S3 bucket and versatile database connectors, empowering developers to manage and analyze their data with ease. Written in C++, LocalHive is robust, efficient, and future-focused, enabling seamless integration with your projects.

## Features

- **Local S3 Bucket**: Access and manage a fully functional local S3 bucket for your development needs.
- **Database Connectors**: Seamlessly connect to multiple databases including:
  - MongoDB
  - SQLite
  - Redis
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Cassandra
  - MariaDB
- **Data Operations**:
  - Search, create, and edit database tables.
  - Visualize database processes through interactive graphical analytics.
- **Future Plans**: UI-based frontend-backend integration without requiring manual Models, Views, and Controllers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Dependencies**:
  - C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
  - MongoDB, SQLite, Redis (optional: other database clients)
